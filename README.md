# Regiseration
Validate the registration page


Requirement before running the automated test case
(all the requirement is fulfil on windows 8)

As we will run the automation test code, so for this we need to install “pip, Python version 3.x.x (as I wrote the code in Python to automate the registration form) on windows.
After that install selenium using command -
>> pip install –U selenium
Using above command, selenium will be installed in your system (internet connection should be connected).
In the automation code, we have to set the path of the “chrome driver” so you need to download the Chrome Driver and set the path. Now, run the program where it is saved.


Note- You will have to run the file using python command through the command prompt or in the relevent desktop app.
